## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### OAuth Issues

**Problem**: Monday OAuth fails
- **Check**: Redirect URI matches exactly in dev portal
- **Check**: Client ID and Secret are correct

**Problem**: QuickBooks OAuth fails
- **Check**: Sandbox mode is enabled
- **Check**: Redirect URI is correct
- **Check**: Scopes include `com.intuit.quickbooks.accounting`

### Database Issues

**Problem**: Cannot connect to database
- **Solution**: Run `npm run db:dev` to start PostgreSQL

## 📊 Sample Data for Demo

### Monday Board Structure
Create a board named "2024 Budget" with these columns:

| Column Name | Type | Example Values |
|-------------|------|----------------|
| Category | Text | Salaries, Rent, Marketing |
| Budget | Number | 10000, 5000, 3000 |
| Period | Date | Jan 2024 |

### QuickBooks Sandbox Data
Add test transactions:
- Salary expenses: $12,000 (over budget)
- Rent: $4,500 (under budget)
- Marketing: $3,200 (slightly over)

**Expected Variances**:
- Salaries: +$2,000 (20% over) ❌ Critical
- Rent: -$500 (10% under) ✅ Good
- Marketing: +$200 (7% over) ⚠️ Warning
