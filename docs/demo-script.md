## Opening (0:00 - 1:00)

### Welcome & Context Setting

**Script**:
> "Thanks for joining today. I'm excited to show you how **[Company Name]** can eliminate 20+ hours of manual variance reporting every month. Before we dive in, I have a quick question: How much time does your team currently spend comparing budgets from Monday.com with actuals from QuickBooks each month?"

**Listen for**:
- Current process (manual Excel, vlookups, etc.)
- Pain points (errors, time-consuming, delayed insights)
- Team size and roles

**Transition**:
> "Perfect. What I'm about to show you will reduce that from [their answer] hours to just 10 minutes. Let me show you exactly how."

---

## Act 1: The Problem (1:00 - 2:30)

### Show Current State (Without Our Tool)

**Screen**: Show Monday.com board with budget data

**Script**:
> "This is probably familiar to you. Your team plans budgets in Monday.com - I can see you have department budgets, project allocations, and monthly targets all beautifully organized here."

**Scroll through board, point out**:
- Budget columns
- Multiple groups/categories
- Time periods
- Manual tracking attempts

**Then switch to QuickBooks**:
> "And here's where the actuals live - in QuickBooks. Your real spending, revenue, everything financial. The problem? These two systems don't talk to each other. So your team has to export data, use vlookups in Excel, manually match accounts, and create variance reports. Sound familiar?"

**Pause for acknowledgment**

---

## Act 2: The Magic Moment (2:30 - 5:00)

### One-Click Setup

**Script**:
> "Watch this. With FP&A Variance Analyzer, you connect both systems once - it takes 2 minutes."

**Action**: Click "Connect Monday.com"
- Show OAuth flow (30 seconds)
- Select board
- System auto-detects budget columns

**Script**:
> "Notice how it automatically found your budget columns? No configuration needed. Now QuickBooks..."

**Action**: Click "Connect QuickBooks"
- OAuth flow (30 seconds)
- System pulls chart of accounts
- Smart account matching begins

**Script**:
> "Here's where it gets interesting. The system is now intelligently matching your Monday.com line items with QuickBooks accounts. It uses AI to map 'Marketing Budget' to 'Marketing Expenses' and suggests matches. You approve them once, and we remember forever."

**Show**: Account mapping interface
- Highlight confidence scores
- Show bulk approval feature
- Demonstrate override capability

### The First Variance Analysis

**Script**:
> "Alright, we're set up. Now watch - this is what used to take your team hours."

**Action**: Click "Analyze Variance" button

**Script**:
> "That's it. We just pulled January budgets from Monday.com, compared them with January actuals from QuickBooks, calculated variances, and generated insights. 47 line items analyzed in 3 seconds."

**Show results dashboard**:
- Overall variance summary
- Critical items highlighted in red
- Favorable variances in green
- Drill-down capability

---

## Act 3: The Insights (5:00 - 7:30)

### AI-Powered Insights

**Script**:
> "But here's what really saves time - the AI insights. Instead of you manually reviewing every variance to figure out what's important, the system does it for you."

**Click on Critical Insight**: "Marketing Overspend"

**Read aloud**:
> "Marketing & Advertising expenses are 17.5% ($35K) over budget. Primary drivers: Google Ads overspend ($15K above plan), unplanned LinkedIn campaign ($12K), and event sponsorship ($8K). While CAC increased 22% month-over-month, new customer acquisition grew only 8%, indicating declining marketing efficiency."

**Script**:
> "See that? It didn't just say 'you're over budget.' It told you WHY, showed you the breakdown, and even analyzed the efficiency metrics. This would take an analyst 2-3 hours to research and write. The AI did it in seconds."

**Show 2-3 more insights**:
1. Revenue outperformance insight (positive)
2. Cost savings insight (positive)

**Script**:
> "And it's not just problems - it highlights wins too. Your team crushed revenue targets by 11%, and you're 6% under budget on infrastructure. The system makes sure leadership sees both."

### Real-Time Monday Updates

**Script**:
> "Now here's the automation piece. Watch this."

**Action**: Click "Sync to Monday.com"

**Show**: Variance columns automatically populate in Monday.com board
- Variance dollar amount
- Variance percentage
- Severity indicator (🔴/🟡/🟢)
- AI insight summary

**Script**:
> "Your entire team now has real-time variance data right where they already work - in Monday.com. No more waiting for the finance team to send a report. No more 'what's the latest variance?' Slack messages. It's just... there."

---

## Act 4: Time-Travel & Trending (7:30 - 9:00)

### Historical Analysis

**Script**:
> "Your CFO asks: 'How has marketing variance trended over the last 6 months?' With your current process, that's an hour of work. Watch this."

**Action**:
- Select date range: Last 6 months
- Click "Analyze Trend"

**Show**: Trend chart appears
- Line graph of marketing variance over time
- Pattern recognition: "Consistently over budget Q4"
- Seasonal insights

**Script**:
> "Done. The system found a pattern - marketing consistently goes over budget in Q4 due to holiday campaigns. Now you can plan for that next year."

### What-If Scenarios

**Script**:
> "One more powerful feature. Let's say you're planning Q2 and want to model a 10% budget cut to marketing. How does that affect your ability to hit revenue targets?"

**Action**:
- Open scenario planner
- Adjust marketing budget -10%
- Show predictive impact on revenue

**Script**:
> "Based on historical correlation, a 10% marketing cut would likely reduce new customer acquisition by 12%, impacting Q2 revenue by $85K. Now you can make data-driven decisions."

## Act 5: ROI & Pricing (9:00 - 10:00)

### Calculate Their Savings

**Script**:
> "Let's talk about what this means for your team. You mentioned you spend about [X hours] per month on variance reporting. Let's do the math together."

**Show**: ROI Calculator (open in browser)

**Enter their numbers**:
- Hours saved: 20 hours/month
- Hourly rate: $75 (average for finance analyst)
- Monthly savings: $1,500
- Annual savings: $18,000

**Script**:
> "By eliminating manual variance reporting, you save $18,000 per year in labor costs alone. That doesn't include the value of getting insights 20 days faster, or preventing the $35K marketing overspend we saw earlier."

### Pricing & Packaging

**Show pricing tiers**:

**Starter - $49/month**:
- 1 Monday board
- 1 QuickBooks company
- Up to 100 line items
- Weekly auto-sync
- Email insights

**Professional - $149/month** (Recommended):
- Unlimited boards
- Multiple QB companies
- Unlimited line items
- Daily auto-sync
- AI insights in Monday
- Trend analysis
- What-if scenarios
- API access

**Script**:
> "For most teams like yours, Professional is the right fit. At $149/month, you're paying less than 1% of your monthly savings to get the solution. It pays for itself in the first hour of time saved."

### Trial Offer

**Script**:
> "Here's what I suggest: Take a 14-day free trial. I'll personally help you get set up - we'll connect your Monday board and QuickBooks, map your accounts, and run your first variance analysis. You'll see your actual time savings within the first week. If you don't save at least 10 hours in those 14 days, I'll personally buy you lunch. Sound fair?"

## Closing (10:00)

### Next Steps

**Script**:
> "So what are the next steps? I can have you up and running today. The setup takes 15 minutes. When would be a good time this week to do a live setup session together?"

**Listen and schedule**

**Handle Objections**:

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Need to think about it" | "Absolutely. What specific questions can I answer to help your decision? Is it technical, pricing, or implementation related?" |
| "Need to check with team" | "Makes sense. Who else needs to see this? I'm happy to do another 10-minute demo for your CFO/team." |
| "Too busy right now" | "I hear you. That's exactly why we built this - to give you time back. The 15-minute setup will save you 20 hours next month. Can we find 15 minutes this week?" |
| "Budget concerns" | "I understand. Keep in mind this saves you $1,500/month in labor costs. Is there a scenario where saving $18K/year doesn't make sense for a $149/month investment?" |

### Confirmation

**Script**:
> "Perfect! I'm sending you a calendar invite for [day/time] to do the setup together. In the meantime, I'm also sending:
>
> 1. A trial link - activate it anytime
> 2. This demo recording - share with your team

## Demo Tips & Best Practices

### Do's ✅

- **Personalize everything** - Use their company name, their actual budget categories
- **Let them drive** - Ask "What would you like to see next?"
- **Show, don't tell** - Click buttons, don't just talk about features
- **Use their language** - If they say "P&L" not "Income Statement," use their terms
- **Pause for reactions** - After showing time savings, pause and let it sink in
- **Address the decision maker** - If CFO is on the call, direct key points to them

### Don'ts ❌

- **Don't skip the problem** - Always show their pain before the solution
- **Don't rush** - 10 minutes is fast enough; don't cram more in
- **Don't go technical** - They don't care about API endpoints; they care about time savings
- **Don't oversell** - Let the product speak for itself
- **Don't forget to ask for the sale** - Always end with next steps

### Handling Different Personas

**CFO/Finance Director**:
- Focus on: ROI, accuracy, audit trail, strategic insights
- Show: Trend analysis, what-if scenarios, executive dashboard
- Language: "Strategic decision-making," "data-driven," "competitive advantage"

**Finance Manager/Controller**:
- Focus on: Time savings, automation, team efficiency
- Show: Auto-sync, AI insights, Monday integration
- Language: "Streamline process," "reduce manual work," "scale the team"

**Financial Analyst**:
- Focus on: Ease of use, accuracy, eliminating Excel
- Show: One-click analysis, drill-down, export capabilities
- Language: "No more vlookups," "automated matching," "trust the data"

### Emergency Recovery Scripts

**If demo breaks**:
> "Looks like we hit a network issue. Let me show you the video walkthrough instead, and we'll do a live session during your trial."

**If they're not engaged**:
> "I'm sensing this might not be the right fit. What would make this more relevant to your specific situation?"

**If running over time**:
> "I want to respect your time. Can we schedule 5 more minutes to finish, or would you prefer I send the rest via video?"
