Hi {{first_name}},

I noticed you started setting up FP&A Variance Analyzer yesterday but haven't run your first analysis yet.

No worries—setup can feel overwhelming. Let me help.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Where most people get stuck:**

❓ **"I don't know which Monday board to use"**
→ Start with your main budget/planning board. You can add others later.

❓ **"The account mapping is confusing"**
→ Our AI suggests matches with confidence scores. Just approve the green ones (80%+ confidence) and we'll learn from there.

❓ **"I don't have time right now"**
→ It takes 10 minutes total. Here's a [5-minute video] showing exactly what to do.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Want me to do it with you?**

I have 3 open slots today for 15-minute setup calls. I'll share my screen and walk you through it step-by-step.

→ [Book Setup Call - Today's Slots]

Or just reply to this email with "setup help" and I'll send you a personalized guide.

You're one 10-minute setup away from saving 20 hours next month.

Best,
{{sender_name}}

P.S. 87% of users who complete setup in the first 48 hours become paying customers. The value is real—you just need to see it once.

Nice work! You've run {{analysis_count}} variance analyses and saved approximately {{hours_saved}} hours so far.

But you're only scratching the surface. Here are 3 features that will 10x your results:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

→ [Enable Trend Analysis]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**2. 🔔 Monday.com Auto-Sync (Real-Time Updates)**

Stop manually running analyses. Set up daily auto-sync and wake up to fresh variance data in your Monday boards every morning.

Set it once, forget it forever.

→ [Configure Auto-Sync]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**3. 🔮 What-If Scenarios (Plan Ahead)**

Model "what if we cut marketing 10%?" or "what if revenue drops 5%?" See predicted impacts before making decisions.

Turn your finance team into strategic advisors.

→ [Try Scenario Planning]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Pro Tip**: Enable all three features. Our highest-ROI customers use them religiously.

Questions? Just reply—I'm here to help you get maximum value.

Hi {{first_name}},

I see you haven't run your first variance analysis yet. That's okay—I want to understand why so I can help.

Could you reply and let me know which statement below is closest to your situation?

**A)** "I'm too busy right now"
**B)** "I don't understand how to set it up"
**C)** "I'm not sure this will work for our specific setup"

**E)** "Something else" (tell me what)

Just hit reply with the letter (or write your own reason). I read every response personally.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Here's what I can do to help:

→ **Option 1**: I'll send you a custom setup guide based on your Monday boards
→ **Option 2**: Jump on a 15-minute call and I'll do it with you
→ **Option 3**: Send me view-only access and I'll set it up for you (seriously)

The hardest part is the first setup. After that, it's literally 3 clicks to analyze variance.

What would be most helpful?

- Variance reporting takes 45 minutes/month
- Real-time variance data in Monday boards
- AI automatically matches accounts with 98% accuracy
- Caught marketing overspend on day 5, saved $35K

**Sarah's words:**
"We were drowning in Excel. Now our team spends 20+ hours per month on strategic analysis instead of data entry. The ROI was instant."

→ [Read Full Case Study]

## Email #5a: Trial Ending - Active Users (Day 7)

**Goal**: Convert to paid subscription

### Subject Line Options:
- ✅ "Your trial ends in 7 days" (Primary - clear, direct)
- "{{first_name}}, let's talk pricing"
- "Don't lose your variance data"

### Email Body:

```
Subject: Your trial ends in 7 days

Hi {{first_name}},

You've been crushing it! In the past {{trial_days}} days, you've:

✓ Run {{analysis_count}} variance analyses
✓ Saved approximately {{hours_saved}} hours
✓ Analyzed {{line_items_count}} line items
✓ Generated {{insights_count}} AI insights

Your trial ends on {{trial_end_date}}. Here's what happens next:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Recommended Plan: Professional ($149/month)**

Based on your usage ({{boards_count}} boards, {{line_items_count}} line items), Professional is the right fit:

✓ Unlimited boards & line items
✓ Daily auto-sync
✓ AI insights in Monday
✓ Trend analysis
✓ What-if scenarios
✓ API access

**Your ROI**: Based on {{hours_saved}} hours saved, you're on track for a **{{roi}}x return** in Year 1.

→ [Upgrade to Professional - $149/month]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Alternative: Starter ($49/month)**

If you're just getting started:

✓ 1 board, up to 100 line items
✓ Weekly auto-sync
✓ Email insights

→ [Start with Starter - $49/month]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Questions about pricing?**

Common questions I get:

→ Can I switch plans later? *Yes, anytime*
→ What if I go over 100 line items on Starter? *We'll auto-upgrade you and only charge the difference*
→ Can I get a discount? *Reply with "discount" and I'll see what I can do*

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Your variance data and account mappings are safe—we'll preserve everything when you upgrade.

Ready to keep the momentum going?

Best,
{{sender_name}}

P.S. If budget is tight, reply and let's talk. I'd rather work something out than see you go back to Excel hell.

Subject: We noticed you haven't logged in...

Hi {{first_name}},

Your trial ends in 7 days, and I noticed you haven't logged in recently {{if_never_analyzed}}(and never ran a variance analysis){{endif}}.

That's on me. I failed to show you the value.

Before you go, I have one question:

**What would have made this a slam-dunk for you?**

Seriously, I want to know. Reply and tell me:

→ Was it the setup process?
→ Did it not fit your workflow?
→ Were you too busy to get started?
→ Something else entirely?

Your feedback will help us build a better product.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**One Last Offer**

If there's ANY chance this could still work for you, I'll:

1. Personally set up your first variance analysis (15-min call)
2. Extend your trial by 7 days so you have time to see results
3. Give you my direct phone number for instant support

Just reply "yes" and I'll make it happen.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Or Maybe It's Just Not Right**

If this isn't a fit, no worries. Can you do me one favor?

Hit reply and tell me what WOULD solve your variance reporting problem. Even if it's not our tool, I genuinely want to help.

Thank you for trying FP&A Variance Analyzer.

Best,
{{sender_name}}

P.S. If you don't reply, your account will automatically close on {{trial_end_date}}. No charges, no hard feelings.

### Email: Account Mapping Help
**Trigger**: User has 5+ unmapped accounts
**Timing**: 2 hours after detection

```
Subject: Help with account mapping

Hi {{first_name}},

I see you have {{unmapped_count}} accounts that haven't been mapped yet.

This is normal—our AI can't always guess correctly for unique account names.

Here's the fastest way to finish:

**For High-Confidence Matches (Green):**
→ Just click "Approve All" - our AI is 98% accurate on these

**For Medium-Confidence (Yellow):**
→ Review the suggestion and confirm or correct

**For Low-Confidence (Red):**
→ Use the search to find the right QuickBooks account

**Pro Tip**: Map your top 20 accounts first (by dollar value). That usually covers 80% of your variance.

Need help? Reply to this email with a screenshot and I'll map them for you.

You're almost there!

Best,
{{sender_name}}
